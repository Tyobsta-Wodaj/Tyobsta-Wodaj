# Operating System Project Documentation

## a. Zorin OS Installation

This documentation explains how to install Zorin OS using VirtualBox.  
First, the Zorin OS ISO file is downloaded from the official website.  
A virtual machine is created in VirtualBox with adjusted RAM and storage settings.  
The ISO is booted, and the guided installer is followed to complete the OS setup.  
This process provides a Linux-based environment for system-level development.

## b. System Call (Implementation)

System calls are interfaces between a user program and the operating system kernel.  
In this project, basic system calls like `fork()`, `exec()`, and `getpid()` are used.  
`fork()` is used to create a new child process, and `exec()` replaces the current process image with a new one.  
These calls demonstrate how user-level programs interact directly with the OS.  
This project helps understand how system-level tasks are handled in Linux-based systems.
